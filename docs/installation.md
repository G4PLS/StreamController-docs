: This is currently the only way to install StreamController, because it is still in heavy development.

    1. Clone StreamController from [GitHub](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) by typing:
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Core447/StreamController
        ```
    2. Enter the `StreamController` directory:
        ```sh
        cd StreamController
        ```
    3. Create a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):
        ```sh
        python -m venv .venv
        ```
    4. Activate the virtual environment:
        ```sh
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    5. Install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) requirements:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    6. Launch the app:
        ```sh
        python3 main.py
        ```
