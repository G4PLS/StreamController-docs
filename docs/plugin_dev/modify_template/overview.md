In this section I want to go through several exapmles of modifying the template.

1. [Add a counter action](AddCounter.md)
<!-- 2. [Add a backend action](add_a_backend_action.md) -->
<!-- 3. [Add a backend to the plugin itself](add_a_backend_to_plugin.md) -->

Let's get started getting your hand dirty!!!
