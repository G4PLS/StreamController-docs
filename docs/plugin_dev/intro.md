# Plugin Development

Understanding that no single application can cater to the unique needs and preferences of every individual, I've empowered users to tailor their experience by developing their own plugins. This customization ensures that the functionality of the application aligns perfectly with their requirements.

[StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) features enhanced plugin support, enabling developers like you to easily create plugins using [Python](https://python.org). The choice of [Python](https://python.org) as the core language for [StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) wasn't arbitrary; it was selected for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it an ideal choice for plugin development.

## Official Plugins

StreamController is complemented by a suite of official plugins designed to enhance your experience:

- [OBS Plugin](https://github.com/Core447/OBSPlugin) to control [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
- [Media Plugin](https://github.com/Core447/MediaPlugin) to control playing audio and video content
- [Deck Plugin](https://github.com/Core447/DeckPlugin) to control your [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) on a new level
- [OS Plugin](https://github.com/Core447/OSPlugin) to control your OS

## No [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck)?
No problem, just use a FakeDeck!

FakeDecks are emulated original [StreamDecks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) for testing purposes.  
Therefore you can use them to test and develop plugins without any real [StreamDeck](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck).

### Enable FakeDecks
1. Open Settings
2. Go to Developer Settings
3. Increase the number of FakeDecks (max 3)
4. If you change from 0 to 1..3 please restart the app (This will not be needed in future versions)
