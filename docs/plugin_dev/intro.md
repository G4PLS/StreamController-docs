# Plugin Development

Understanding that no single application can cater to the unique needs and preferences of every individual, I've empowered users to tailor their experience by developing their own plugins. This customization ensures that the functionality of the application aligns perfectly with their requirements.

[StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) features enhanced plugin support, enabling developers like you to easily create plugins using [Python](https://python.org). The choice of [Python](https://python.org) as the core language for [StreamController](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController) wasn't arbitrary; it was selected for its simplicity and ease of learning, making it an ideal choice for plugin development.

## No [Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck)?
No problem, just use a FakeDeck!

FakeDecks are emulated original [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck) for testing purposes, allowing you to test and develop plugins without any physical [Stream Decks](https://www.elgato.com/uk/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck).

### Enable FakeDecks
1. Open Settings
2. Go to Developer Settings
3. Increase the number of FakeDecks (max 3)
