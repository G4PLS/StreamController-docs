To get the most out of StreamController you can easily create your own plugin.


And the best of it is that there are just four major steps to get started with developing your own plugin:


1. Come up with an idea
2. Download StreamController's source code
3. Copy the [plugin template](https://github.com/Core447/PluginTemplate)
![PluginTemplageGit](../assets/PluginTemplateGit.png)
4. Modify the template
5. Submit your plugin to the [Store](https://github.com/Core447/StreamController-Store)

Ok, ok, that was probably a bit too quick, so let's take a closer look at the process in the [next sections](./plugin_template/overview.md).
