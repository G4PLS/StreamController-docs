### What is StreamController?
<!-- bot: ? -->
StreamController is the Linux alternative to the Windows/Mac Elgato Stream Deck Software.

### Do plugins for the Elgato Software work in StreamController?
<!-- bot: elgato-plugins -->
No, they currently don't work with StreamController, and we are not developing this feature at the moment. However, this **may** come in the future.

### What does "official" stand for in the plugins?
<!-- bot: official-badge -->
This means the plugin was created by the maintainer and lead dev, [Core447](https://github.com/Core447).

### How can I create my own plugin?
<!-- bot: plugin-dev -->
Firstly, check if the plugin you want to create doesn't exist or is not being developed. If something already exists, you may be able to work with the developer of that plugin to make it better. If it doesn't exist, the Plugin Template and the [Wiki](https://streamcontroller.github.io/docs) are a great place to start.
